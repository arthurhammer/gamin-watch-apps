Simple apps and data fields for Garmin watches. Built with [Garmin's Connect IQ SDK](http://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/overview/) and their Monkey C programming language.

## Activity Steps Data Field

Useful if you set yourself a step goal or just want to know how many steps you've taken for the given activity.

Excludes steps before the activity and those during pauses.
